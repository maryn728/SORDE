Software for Object Recognition and Distance Estimation

This project aims to use OpenCV for recognizing, tracking, and estimating distances to objects for future development of marker-less augmented reality applications or as an aid for visually impaired individuals. SORDE(Software for object recognition and distance estimation) is written in C++ and makes use of OpenCV and Qt.
Object categorization:
    - Compute SURF descriptors and keypoints in all template images
    - Compute training data for the SVM classifiers
    - Train a one-vs.-all SVM for each category of object using the training data
    - Classify by using the trained SVMs
Distance estimation:
    - Get depth from disparity - reprojectImageTo3d() does this by taking the disparity and the disparity-to-depth mapping matrix Q generated by stereoRectify()
                                
File -Load Dictionary: Load BOW vocabulary from file
File -Generate template keypoints: Generates SURF keypoints and descriptors for object categories template images
File -Add object: add new category to BOW vocabulary and train SVM to recognize that category, the dialog can be used to capture the template image and the training images
File -Camera Calibration: Calibrates the left and right cameras individually, stereo calibration and stereo rectification


TIP: Make sure to disable your laptopâ€™s built-in webcam, especially if you are using a stereo camera built from two individual USB webcams

In my initial build I used Qt 5.3.1, OpenCV 2.4.6 and Visual Studio 2012, the .pro file was generated using Qt Creator 3.1.2
To build from source modify the .pro file to link your version of OpenCV
